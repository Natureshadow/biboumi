Description: XMPP gateway to connect to IRC servers
 This package translates between XMPP and IRC protocols. It can be used to
 connect to IRC channels using any XMPP client as if these channels were XMPP
 MUCs.
 .
 The goal is to provide a way to access most of IRC features using any XMPP
 client. It doesn’t however try to provide a complete mapping of the features of
 both worlds simply because this is not useful and most probably impossible.
 .
 If IRC is the limiting factor then biboumi doesn’t try to work around this
 issue. An important goal of the tool is to keep the software light and simple.
